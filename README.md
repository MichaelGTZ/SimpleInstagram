Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to handle the comments and likes in Parse as well as programatically to make sure that the home screen and detailed post screen show correct information
2. How to use the actual instagram API to make an app similar to SimpleTweet

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Whilst trying to implement a like count, I was unable to figure out how to change the icon between its filled in and outlined form based on if a user has clicked it or not. Without this, I wasn't able to properly implement the likes feature, as I wasn't able to show accurate like counts and add/remove from a posts like count. I believe I could have gotten this to work with more time spent studying Parse workflow.
